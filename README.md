FRONTEND -- MIDDLE-END -- BACKEND

Need for Api Gateway ?
- We need an intermediate layer between client side and microservices.
- Using this middle-end, when client sends request we will be able to make decision that which service should actually responf to this request.
- We can do msg validation, rate limiting, responnse transformation.
- So our Api Gateway is going to act as a middle end.
